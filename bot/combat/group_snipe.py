"""Group blink-snipe and focus-fire helper functions for Stalker micro.

Purpose: Damage math, target evaluation, stalker selection, and coordinated execution.
    Snipe-A: walk-in, blink-out (safe, for targets we outrange or match).
    Snipe-B: blink-in, walk-out (riskier, for targets that outrange us).
    Focus: multi-volley pursuit (blink or walk in, stay on target until dead/abort).
Key Decisions: Reuses existing TACTICAL_BONUS + army_value for target value; uses python-sc2's
    calculate_damage_vs_target for exact damage math; cy_* for all hot-path geometry.
    Skip-set pattern (bot._snipe_committed / bot._focus_committed) prevents per-unit micro
    from overriding group commands.
Limitations: calculate_damage_vs_target doesn't model Guardian Shield on enemies we haven't
    attacked yet (BuffId check). Overkill buffer compensates.
