      3. Stay safe (two-layer: avoid grid + ground grid) and follow army

    Force Field split is computed once per squad (in combat.py) across all
    sentries pooling their energy, then each sentry executes its assigned
    casts. This ensures coordinated FF placement that a single sentry
    couldn't achieve alone.

    Guardian Shield assignment is computed once per squad (in combat.py) via
    _compute_guardian_shield_assignments(), which builds a friendly-density
    influence map and greedily assigns each Sentry to the densest uncovered
    pocket. Already-shielded areas are zeroed (exclusion-mask pattern, like
    Disruptor Nova), so Sentries spread to different pockets instead of
    stacking. A Sentry deploys only if an uncovered pocket exists — no
    redundant deployment into already-covered areas.

    When gs_target is set (this Sentry was approved and assigned a peak),
    it paths to that peak instead of ranged_center, so it reaches the
    pocket it's responsible for covering. KeepUnitSafe layers stay first
    in the maneuver chain — safety always overrides placement.
